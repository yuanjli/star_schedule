  <h3>4. Do your coaches have air conditioning/heating?
</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    Yes.  We believe that this is an absolute must.  We consider it our responsibility that you have a pleasant journey.  You may visit the "our fleet" page online for more information about our coaches.
    </p>
    	</div>

    <h3>5. Can we eat food on the bus?

</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    Yes.  We have no problems with our guests eating during travel.  We request that our passengers try to minimize the collection of trash in the bus as this can be a potential safety hazard.  If requested, we can even instruct the driver to make scheduled stops along the way so that our passengers may purchase food or eat at specific locations.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>6. Is the deposit refundable?</h3>
  <div>
  	
  	No.  Once the deposit has been made and a timeslot has been reserved for your group, we cannot book trips for other customers at this time.  Therefore, we require a nonrefundable deposit to book trips and prevent abuse of our services.

  </div>
  
  <h3>7. What if I have to cancel my trip?
</h3>
  <div>
  	
  	We understand that sudden changes in plans can occur. If you cancel your trip and more than 14 days remain before your departure, all of your submitted funds (excluding your reservation deposit) will be refunded. If you cancel your trip within fourteen (14) days before departure, then only 50% of the total payment will be refunded.
  </div>
  
  <h3>8. Which methods of payment do you accept?
</h3>
  <div>
  	
  	We accept personal checks via mail or in person. Cash may ONLY be given to us in person. We also accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express). We may also accept cashier's checks and wire transfers. If you would like to use another method for payment, please contact us.
